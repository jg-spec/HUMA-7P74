Here is my short bio:

My practice aligns with a number of intersecting movements that emerged in the 1960s, including body art, performance-based video, and land art. In my work, I aim to explore our profound connection with the natural world by probing the edges of identity and environment, interiority and exteriority, the tamed and the wild, and the places where the two merge. My post-secondary background consists of a BA in Visual Arts and English Literature from Brock University and an MFA from Ryerson University in Documentary Media.

Iâ€™m currently working toward a PhD in Interdisciplinary Humanities, conducting research that reimagines materiality within the context of the human body and its entanglement with the physical world. I aim to challenge previously-held characterizations of the autonomous individual and encourage new narratives that work to realign the Anthropocene subject as inextricably interconnected to the world. My research pivots on the concept of trans-corporeality, a term coined by material feminist Stacy Alaimo, and can be explained as the movement of matter across and within bodies and nature, by which human beings are inseparable from the environment, both natural and man-made. I like to frame my research interests by sharing a sentiment from modern dancer Martha Graham, who, during WWII, observed how daily newspaper headlines affected the muscles in the bodies of her dancers. In other words, my research investigates the ways in which the world takes up residence in the body.
